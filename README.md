## 🧠 What Is the LoL Bot?

The **League of Legends Bot** is a fully scripted system that plays the game for you – yes, plays the game. It doesn't just spam random inputs, it uses decision trees, lane logic, and movement prediction to **act like a real player**, all while you kick back or multi-task.

Works in blind pick, bots mode, and even low-ELO ranked if you set it up correctly. Totally customizable and stealth-coded to avoid detection 🚫👀

## 🔧 Core Features

### 🤖 Auto Lane AI

The bot picks a lane, walks to tower, and stays safe while farming minions. Reacts to wave pushes and plays passively or aggressively based on your settings.

### 🎯 Skill Casting Logic

Casts abilities based on cooldowns, mana, and target range. Works best with easy champs like Ashe, Garen, Malzahar, Annie, or Master Yi.

### 🪙 CS & XP Farming

Auto-attacks minions with accurate timing to farm gold and gain XP. Keeps the champ in XP range while avoiding risky trades.

### 🛍️ Item Buy & Recall System

Buys items based on preset build paths and recalls safely when low HP. Never gets stuck in base or caught recalling at bad times.

### 🛡️ Tower Awareness

Avoids turret aggro and knows how to reset it. Moves back when enemy champs overextend under tower.

### 🎮 Fully AFK-Ready

Set it and leave it. The bot will play 100% of the game solo from loading screen to end.
